It is an acknowledgment that being close does not have to mean knowing, that there is value in the questioning and the complicating of knowing. If you are close to the metal then you are committed to re-evaluating and re-framing complex systems in order to have a fuller understanding of them. In this age of ubiquitous networked computing being close to the metal can mean beginning to unpack the underlying mechanics of this ubiquity,<span class="scroll">scroll down</span></p>
